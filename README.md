# cli-chess

An object-oriented chess game played in the terminal. Still a a work in progress, but will be testing soon!

The chess engine is entirely coded from scratch by myself (Jacob). I wanted to code it from scratch literally just for the experience. Turned out to be way more difficult than I'd anticipated, but so much dang fun.

It's very object-oriented using lots of classes and methods to make things work.

It also features a custom `useChessGame` React hook. YES. React.

This game uses (Ink)[https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink] to generate the cli view with React. Take a look around the repo, you'll see what I mean. I love it.

## Test out the game!

This is absolutely not ready to play yet. But you can totally move pieces around the board so that's cool.

If you want a little preview of how this will work, clone it and get it up and running!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacobdcastro/cli-chess.git
cd cli-chess
npm install
node src/cli.js
```

You should see a little chess board, pieces, and move the cursor around! You can use `ctrl + c` to exit the app.

## CLI

More soon to come!
